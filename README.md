In this project, I will be exploring and analyzing sales data to gain insights into the trends and patterns of sales over time. By answering the following questions: 

- What are the top-performing product categories and sub-categories in terms of profitability in the sales data?
- How wide is the range of revenue and cost values in the dataset?
- Which states are leading the way in terms of sales performance?
- How has the overall sales growth rate changed over the years?
- In which year did the revenue and cost reach its peak?
- Which category is the most in-demand among customers?
- Is there any correlation between the sales of different products in the dataset?
- Are there any correlations between the sales of different products?

In the cause of answering some of these questions, I will also be using graphs to show the trends and pattern in the sales analysis. 

#### About The Dataset
The dataset I will be using, was obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhishekrp1517/sales-data-for-economic-data-analysis?select=salesforcourse-4fe2kehu.csv), an online site to get free datasets.The sales dataset contains information on transactions, including the products sold, their cost and revenue, and the volume of products sold. It also includes customer age, gender, and location, offering insights into purchasing behavior across different demographic groups. There are over 34800 entries in the dataset, and it can be useful for data analysts and businesses who want to explore trends and patterns in their sales data. 

To perform this analysis, I will be using Python and the Pandas library, which provides powerful tools for data manipulation and analysis. I will also be using Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.

This project was completed as part of the course 'Data Analysis with Python: Zero to Pandas', which provided a comprehensive introduction to Python, Pandas, and data analysis techniques. Through this course, I learned how to clean and preprocess data, explore data using statistical methods, and create visualizations to communicate my findings. This project is a practical application of the skills learned during the course.
